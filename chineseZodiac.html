      <h1>Chinese Zodiac & New Year</h1>
      <h2>Chinese New Year (春节)</h2>
      <p style="margin-top: 32px; text-align: left; max-width: 1000px;">
        Chinese New Year is a celebration that transcends simple calendar dates. It is a profound cultural reset—a time 
        to sweep away the ill fortune of the past year and welcome the "new" with open arms, loud sounds, and the color red.<br/> <br/>

      The festival is rooted in a legend about a mythical beast called Nian(年). Every year, Nian would emerge to eat livestock and villagers. 
        The people eventually discovered that the beast was terrified of the color red, bright lights, and loud noises. This is why, even today, 
        the holiday is defined by red lanterns, firecrackers, and the rhythmic beating of drums.</p>

        <h2>The Lunar Cycle and the Great Race</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;  max-width: 1000px;">
        The Chinese Zodiac (Shengxiao) is a 12-year cycle where each year is represented by an animal. According to legend, the Jade Emperor organized a "Great Race" across 
        a river to determine the order of the zodiac signs. The order they finished the race is the order they appear in the calendar today. Below is a detailed look at the 12 
        animals of the Chinese Zodiac:</p>

      <h2>How to Celebrate Your Zodiac Year</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;  max-width: 1000px;">
       In Chinese culture, when it is the year of your zodiac sign (Ben Ming Nian), it is actually considered a year of challenges. To ward off bad luck, 
       people often wear red clothing or red accessories (like a red string bracelet) given to them by an elder. </p>
